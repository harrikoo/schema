TODO list
* TODO LocalNotifications on ios
Currently donot work. Solution: need to request/grant permissions. See https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/local-notifications-capacitor-react-do-not-trigger-on-ios/223408

Need to check for persmissions at app start, and request if not granted. Check for permissions too before setting local notifications.
* TODO Camera permissions
Need to be set for Andrdoid. Check how work for iOS.
